# Root-Finding-Methods
The aim of this assignment is to compare and analyze the behavior of numerical methods studied in class {Bisection, False-position, Fixed point, Newton-Raphson, Secant}.</br></br>
The program contains the following features:</br>
● An interactive GUI that enables the user to enter equations containing different functions such as: {poly, exp, cos, sin}. Reading from files must be available as well.
● Differentiation and Parsing is your task.</br>
● A way to choose a method to solve the given equation.</br>
● A way to enter the precision and the max number of iterations otherwise default values are used,
Default Max Iterations = 50, Default Epsilon = 0.00001;</br>
● The answer for the chosen method indicates the number of iterations, execution time, all iterations, approximate root, and precision.</br>
● Compute the theoretical bound of the error for the methods.</br>
